**_--- Width ----_**
The charts width expands to full the container its in...you dont have to set a property

**_---- Height ----_**
The height of the chart will fill its container if the container has a [px] set property and you set the chart height to [null].

**_---- Overall ----_**
The charts are neat and fairly easy,, but docs and the ability to resize them and make responsive is annoying as fuk.
